## What It Does
The application allows you to create a list of states you'll be visiting and provides road laws and famous landmarks at the user's convenience.

## Motivation
This web application was developed for KnightHack's Projects 2022. I worked in a group of four over a course of two and a half months. I played the role of Project Lead, Graphic Designer, and Front-End.

## Features
- User is able to sign in and create an account in order to keep track of their road trip.
- User can select a state to add to their road trip from a drop-down menu and continue to add on to the list.
- Road laws for each state is automatically displayed along with individualized landmarks.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JS were used to create the web app, while Firebase JS and JS was utilized for back-end.
